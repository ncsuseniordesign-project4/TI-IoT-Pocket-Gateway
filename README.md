# TI-IoT-Pocket-Gateway

PCB Design 

Change Notes:
   -4/4/2020 11AM: Added pocketbeagle pinout to document with library.  I will modify it but the part can hang out as a reference.



Work to do:
  -Voltage Regulator: I think we need a SOT-23 form factor chip for size reasons.  The current one may still fit though.
  -SMD pin fooprint:  I need to convert the pocketBeagle(PB) pins to an SMD .1" pin header for the bottom side connection to the PB.
  -SIM Card Diodes: We should replace the diodes with the packaged diode array in the reference schematic.  It is a SOT-23 package.
  -Buttons: We should tranisiton to smaller form factor buttons.
